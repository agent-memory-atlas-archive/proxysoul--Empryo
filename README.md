## What it does

- **It reads the map first.** It knows what an edit will touch before it makes it.
- **It edits by name.** A function or class, replaced exactly.
- **It checks its own work.** Typecheck, lint and tests, fixed in the same turn.
- **It remembers.** Decisions and past bugs, per project.
